Most Chinese tomatoes come from the Xinjiang region, where production is linked to forced labour by Uyhgur and other largely Muslim minorities.

McGregor told his millions of social media followers on Tuesday that “the fight game awaits” – but retailers pulled products linked to him from shelves, murals of him were erased and brands announced they had cut ties.

It followed a 12-person jury in Dublin finding McGregor guilty of sexual assault in a civil case brought by Nikita Hand, who accused him of raping her at a Dublin hotel in December 2018. 

She was awarded nearly €250,000 (£208,000) in damages.

In a social media post, McGregor said he would appeal the decision.

Ms Hand’s case was one of several legal issues and controversies that McGregor has faced over the past few years.

The country’s Ministry of Employment and Labor dismissed claims of workplace harrassment against a member of the NewJeans Kpop group, saying celebrities were not seen as workers under the country’s labour law - and were, therefore, not entitled to the same rights.

The decision has drawn its fair share of scorn, with people saying they are not surprised given this is an industry known for its punishing schedules and intense competition.

“Individuals must meet the criteria under the Labour Standards Act... to be considered workers. This includes having fixed working hours and providing labour under the employer’s direct supervision and control. Celebrities, including singers, are typically classified as independent contractors,” Chunghwan Choi, senior partner of Yulchon law firm in Seoul explained.

The crew aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Healy were working on a project to map the seafloor off the coast of Alaska, US, when they found it - 1,600 metres beneath them. 
 
A possible gas plume has been detected rising from it, but the experts have said it's no threat to people.

The mega coral is a collection of many connected, tiny creatures that together form one organism rather than a reef.

The monument is intended to honour the development initiatives President Nana Akufo-Addo has overseen whilst in office, but some people believe it is ""self glorification"".
 
The president, who is standing down in January has boasted that he has fulfilled 80% of his promises to Ghanaians - including scrapping fees for secondary school.
 
But critics have questioned the importance of the statue when several key projects remain incomplete in the country.
 
Others have praised the statue and see it as an acknowledgement of Akufo-Addo's contributions to the development of the country.

DCMsarlKaYd,"Is dyeing clothes about to get more environmentally friendly?
 
The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.
 
The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world’s industrial water pollution - and 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.
 
But there are companies trying to change that, trying dye processes which use less water.
 
UK-based start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out digital dyeing in Taiwan, and there are other companies using dye processes which claim to use less water too. 
 
China-based textile company NTX says it has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40% 
 
A Swedish start-up, Imogo, also uses a “digital spray application” with similar environmental benefits.

Kirsi Niinimäki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles says the solutions offered by these companies look “quite promising” – but that she would like to see more specific information about issues like fabric durability.

DCMe3P5q_P4,"A bamboo sunhat that was looted from an indigenous population by British colonisers is returning home to Borneo.
 
The cultural artefact was taken from the Kenyah Badeng people of Sarawak, Borneo, during British-led war expeditions in 1895 and 1896.
 
It was acquired in 1923 by Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, but has never been displayed to the public.
 
The museum's director, Prof Dr Laura Van Broekhoven, said she was ""pleased the sunhat will be returning home"", having been ""so violently taken"".
 
Sarawak, now part of modern-day Malaysia, was ruled as an independent monarchy by the British Brooke family between 1841 and 1941.
 
The family, known as the White Rajahs, regularly ordered war expeditions as a method of dealing with resistance from the regions' indigenous populations.

And things aren't looking much different for the girls, with just over one in four female high schoolers having had their first kiss.
 
These are the lowest figures recorded since Japan first began asking teenagers about their sexual habits back in 1974 - and are likely to be a worry in a country with one of the world's lowest birth rates.

Sticky smelly balls which washed up and closed eight beaches in Sydney last month have been identified by Australian scientists.

Each ball was slightly different but had a firm surface - hardened partially by accumulating sand and minerals like calcium - and a soft core.

Testing by chemists has determined the balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill, though their exact origin remains unknown.

DByheVDM45Y,"Some young French people of African descent are leaving Europe in search of a better life in Africa. They are choosing to leave France amid a backdrop of rising far right politics, a lack of opportunities, and social tensions.
 
For Menka who was born in Paris, leaving France is about finding better opportunities in Senegal.
 
He says in France there is a “glass ceiling” and little diversity to be seen in leadership roles. To him Africa feels more like “open arms” where “there is everything left to build.”
 
The BBC has followed this “silent exodus” through the lives of some French young people who are making the opposite journey their parents made decades earlier, all while capturing the challenges they face in building a new life away from what they know.

The case centred on Erik and Lyle Menendez's motive in the murders, in which their parents were shot 13 times as they watched television.

George Gascón, LA County's top prosecutor, announced on Thursday that new evidence in the case merited a review of their life sentences.

The popular tourist destination plans to extend its tourist entrance fee through next year.
 
Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said the tax aims at helping the city fight with overtourism and ""give Venice the respect it deserves”.
 
The Italian city will also double the number of days it charges tourists for entering it - and if day trippers book ahead they will have to pay €5 (£4.17; $5.41). 
 
For last-minute visitors the fee would be €10 if they book less than four days in advance.

DBQpsFdqUcO,"""We make no apologies for delivering on our commitments to reduce crime for all Territorians.""
 
Children as young as 10 can soon be jailed once again in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), after the government there lowered the age of criminal responsibility.

Australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise it, from 10 to 14, in line with other developed countries and UN advice.

NT authorities argued that returning the age to 10 will ultimately protect children - despite doctors, human rights organisations and Indigenous groups disputing that logic.
 
Opponents to the change cite evidence that the laws will not reduce crime and will disproportionately affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.

The NT already jails children at a rate 11 times higher than any other jurisdiction in the country, and almost all of them are Aboriginal.

In what has been described in a UN statement as ""shocking violations"", the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said two Israel Defense Forces tanks destroyed the main gate of a post in Ramyah, near the border with Israel.

The statement comes after Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Unifil to move away from areas where fighting was taking place ""immediately"".

WWF UK head Tanya Steele said the loss of wild spaces was “putting many ecosystems on the brink”, and many habitats were “on the edge of very dangerous tipping points”.

Fiona Harvey claims the streaming giant told ""brutal lies"" about her to more than 50 million viewers around the world.

The show, created by Richard Gadd, is billed as ""a true story"", but certain key events, like the conviction for stalking, did not happen in real life, Judge Gary Klausner concluded.

Netflix also said the similarities between the real and fictionalised people were so broad that average viewers would not have been able to identify Ms Harvey as Martha. But the court disagreed.

The judge said “This is not the typical case where a plaintiff happens to be one of hundreds of people that match a fictional character’s broad characteristics.

""Martha and Plaintiff [Ms Harvey] have specific similarities that few others could claim to share,” said the judge.

DATbz5_KZoG,"A new species of “ghost shark” has been discovered by New Zealand scientists. 👻

Also known as spookfish, the rare creatures are very hard to spot because of how deep they live in the Pacific Ocean.

Closely related to sharks and rays, they do not have scales and their skeletons are made completely of cartilage.

This newly discovered species has been given a scientific name inspired by the grandmother of one of the scientists.

DASvaXuKWQA,"""It’s a victory for Ukraine.”
 
Russia's chess team is to remain banned from international competitions, officials have ruled - along with its ally Belarus.
 
In a dramatic move, an International Chess Federation (Fide) general assembly meeting in Budapest voted to maintain sanctions against the two countries.
 
Both nations were kicked out of the federation after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
 
Those supporting the move say chess in Russia is controlled by Vladimir Putin, with people including the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, sitting on the board which runs the game domestically.
 
""This vote means that Russia does not have enough support that they assumed they had,"" Ukrainian Chess Federation's Viktor Kapustin told the BBC.

Routh is so far facing two federal gun crime charges, including for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.
 
But federal prosecutors said in court on Monday that they would ask a grand jury in the coming days to also charge Routh with the more serious crime of plotting to assassinate a political candidate, saying that evidence suggests he had been plotting an attack on Trump.

DAQXo1LqOCf,"Sri Lanka's new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been sworn into office.
 
The 55-year-old has promised ""clean"" politics as the country recovers from its worst economic crisis.
 
Saturday's election was the first since 2022 when mass protests over the state of the economy unseated the country's leader, Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
 
The election went to a second count for the first time in Sri Lanka's history. It was described as one of the country's closest ever.
 
Dissanayake has promised voters tough anti-corruption measures and to revive the economy.
 
The country has struggled to import essentials such as fuel and public debt has ballooned to $83bn while inflation soared to 70%. This has made basics such as food and medicine unaffordable to ordinary people.
