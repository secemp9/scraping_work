# scraping_work

Went through multiple iteration.

Did selenium first, then playright, then puppeteer. Lastly stopped at ajax/curl request replay (faster).

Currently the file get_ids.py is the first one I had to run with cli arguments.

Then proxy_json.py using paid proxies (free proxies and tor ip didn't work...).
