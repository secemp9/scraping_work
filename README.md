# scraping_work

stack used:
- selenium (Python)
- playwright (Python)
- puppeteer (Nodejs)
- ajax/curl (Nodejs/Python)


Goal of all my scraping work is to aim to always try to do things without any proxies or account.
Do UX and UI exploration, act as an user. Look at network requests. Try to replay ajax/curl request.
Study payloads and look at js files (deobfuscated or not)

Each directories correspond to the website I worked on, with the scripts used for data scraping.
